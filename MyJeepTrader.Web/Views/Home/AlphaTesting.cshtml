                    <h2>About MyJeepTrader.com</h2>
                    <p>
                        Welcome to MyJeepTrader.com! First off, I'd like to thank you for stopping by and checking out the website!
                        MyJeepTrader.com is a new idea for the jeep community. My idea for this is a different from most of your forum's
                        used by the jeep community. I wanted to bring a place that is just relevent to everything jeeps. But I also wanted
                        to make it a fun and new experience. So I thought of MyJeepTrader.com which is a hybrid of a service and a social media
                        site. The site is still in development and not all features have been implemented yet. But I wanted a place where I can
                        search for jeeps or jeep accessories and a place to post things about my jeep or my jeep experiences.

                        With MyJeepTrader.com, there are two different types of accounts. There will be free users and premium users. The free users
                        will have the option to upgrade at anytime. The features that the free users will have are: 
                        <ul>
                            <li>Ability to create a post</li>
                            <li>Ability to create a user profile</li>
                            <li>Ability to create a single jeep profile</li>
                            <li>Message box to create and view messages</li>
                            <li>Receive and respont to instant chat</li>

                        The Features of the premium accounts are the same as the free users and:

                        <ul>
                            <li>Ability to create multiple jeep profiles</li>
                            <li>Ability to initiate instant chat</li>

                            <li>No Ads!</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <h2>Future Ideas</h2>
                    <p>
                        Currently the site allows users to create a personal profile. The site also allows you to create one or more jeep profiles for all the jeeps
                        you may own! But some features are missing from alpha testing. A few features that are missing are:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Friends List</li>
                            <li>A Timeline - to view friends jeeping activities!</li>
                            <li>Instant Chat</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>

                    <h2>About Alpha Testing</h2>
                    <p>
                        Thank you for alpha testing MyJeepTrader.com!
                        Alpha testing is key for MyJeepTrader.com to see if there is a need and want for a service like MyJeepTrader.com provides.
                        Currently the state of MyJeepTrader is in it's infancy and the site is far from perfect yet.
                        Alpha testing is usually done internally while beta testing is normally open to the public, but being a small (1 man) company, opening
                        alpha testing to the public only makes sense. Alpha testing will be for a small number of people, roughly 10 users. This will help me see
                        if a service like this will survive in the marketplace. Please share your thoughts in the "Feedback" page of the website. Thank you!

                    <p>
                        If feedback from Alpha testing is positive, there will be much more for Beta testing in the coming months!
